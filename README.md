Colors: Dark header/footer, light background, orange buttons.

Hero background: Large background image with overlay for contrast.

Buttons (.btn): Rounded corners, hover effect.

Flexbox: Used in features section to align items in 3 columns.

Responsive design (basic): Since we used max-width and flexible units, it works decently on mobile, but can be improved further.

ðŸ”¹ How It Works in Real Life

This template is like a mini website for selling a product.

The visitor lands on the hero section, sees the product idea, and clicks Buy Now.

They can scroll to features to learn why the product is special.

Then they see the actual product image with an Order button.

Finally, they reach the footer for company info & contact.
